# GameResources

### Instructions

1. Download Pong.zip (or CloudScape.zip) from the files above
2. Import that zip file into your eclipse workspace
    - Right click your workspace
    - Select "Import..."
    - Find the zip file in your downloads folder
3. Run it from the project's "DesktopLauncher.java" file

The above zip files can be downloaded and imported directly into eclipse.  Once in your workspace, in order to test or see what the project does, the project must be run from the "DesktopLauncher.java" file (which contains the main method).  Attempting to run the projects from any other file will very likely result in nothing happening.

### Pong

Approximately 200 lines and 2 files.

Purpose: a template project or "Hello, world!"

### CloudScape

Several thousand lines and a few dozen files.

Purpose: free graphics and assets (which I found on opengameart), possibly some examples of how to do stuff, a fairly large project to poke around in
