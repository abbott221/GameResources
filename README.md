# GameResources

### Instructions

1. Download Pong.zip (or CloudScape.zip) from the files above
2. Import that zip file into your eclipse workspace
    - Right click your workspace
    - Select "Import..."
    - Find the zip file in your downloads folder
3. Run it from the project's "DesktopLauncher.java" file

The above zip files can be downloaded and imported directly into eclipse.  Once in your workspace, in order to test or see what the project does, the project must be run from the "DesktopLauncher.java" file (which contains the main method).  Attempting to run the projects from any other file will very likely result in nothing happening.

### Info

The 2 included projects are examples of how to use a framework called LibGDX to create a videogame.  From my personal experience, LibGDX projects are fairly challenging and tedious to set up, so I have included Pong as a short sample and as a kind of template to write new games on top of.  So, Pong can serve as a LibGDX equivalent to the classic "Hello, World!" program or "ProjectTemplate" project from OSU's Software course series.

I have also included CloudScape, which is a game I have been developing since the end of my freshman year, because it probably has much more interesting graphics and could possibly provide examples of a variety of things that you might try to implement in a videogame, such as a Heads Up Display, multiple screens, drag listeners, etc.  However, it is also possible that the entire project is just confusing as hell, in which case disregard it.

The purpose of these code samples is to provide an introduction to LibGDX and what can be done with it, rather than to serve as an example of how to write videogames. (The software architecture for the code samples is far from outstanding, particularly with CloudScape which is clearly still a work in progress).
